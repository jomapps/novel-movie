# Initial Concept Collection System

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive collection system created for the Initial Concept Step of the Novel Movie workflow. The system transforms the basic 8-field concept into a robust, professional-grade creative blueprint with 12 main fields supported by multiple lookup collections.

## System Architecture

### Main Collection
- **InitialConcepts** (`initial-concepts`) - The primary collection that stores all concept data for each project

### Supporting Lookup Collections
1. **Genres** (`genres`) - Film genres with detailed characteristics and AI generation tags
2. **AudienceDemographics** (`audience-demographics`) - Target audience classifications
3. **ToneOptions** (`tone-options`) - Story tone options with visual and audio guidance
4. **MoodDescriptors** (`mood-descriptors`) - Emotional atmosphere descriptors
5. **CentralThemes** (`central-themes`) - Core thematic elements for storytelling
6. **CinematographyStyles** (`cinematography-styles`) - Visual style approaches

### Additional Collections Needed (To Be Created)
- **AudiencePsychographics** (`audience-psychographics`) - Audience interests and values
- **LightingStyles** (`lighting-styles`) - Lighting approach options
- **CameraMovements** (`camera-movements`) - Camera movement and framing styles
- **ProtagonistTypes** (`protagonist-types`) - Main character archetypes
- **SupportingArchetypes** (`supporting-archetypes`) - Supporting character types
- **MoralQuestions** (`moral-questions`) - Ethical dilemmas for stories
- **TimePeriods** (`time-periods`) - Historical and temporal settings
- **GeographicSettings** (`geographic-settings`) - Location types and settings
- **SocialContexts** (`social-contexts`) - Social, economic, cultural backgrounds
- **StoryScales** (`story-scales`) - Scope and scale of narratives
- **NarrativeStructures** (`narrative-structures`) - Story structure approaches
- **PacingStyles** (`pacing-styles`) - Pacing and rhythm options
- **ClimaxTypes** (`climax-types`) - Climax and resolution styles
- **ContentRestrictions** (`content-restrictions`) - Content guidelines and limitations
- **CulturalSensitivities** (`cultural-sensitivities`) - Cultural considerations

## Field Structure

5. **Visual Style Direction** (cinematography + color palette + lighting + camera movement)

### Enhanced Creative Fields
6. **Reference Materials** (inspirational movies + visual references + narrative references)
7. **Character Archetypes** (protagonist type + supporting roles + relationship dynamics)
8. **Thematic Elements** (central themes + moral questions + message/takeaway)
9. **Setting & World-building** (time period + geographic setting + social context + scale)

### Optional Fields
10. **Pacing & Structure Preferences** (narrative structure + pacing style + climax intensity)
11. **Content Guidelines** (content restrictions + cultural sensitivities + educational value)
12. **Production Considerations** (auto-populated from project data)

## Data Relationships

### One-to-One Relationships
- InitialConcepts → Projects (unique relationship)

### Many-to-Many Relationships
