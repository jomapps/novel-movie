# Tone & Mood Field Separation Implementation

## Overview

Successfully separated the previously merged "Tone & Mood" field into two distinct fields in the Novel Movie project creation and editing forms. This provides better conceptual clarity and more precise story generation data.

## Conceptual Distinction

### **Tone** (Narrative Approach)
- **Purpose**: Defines HOW the story is told
- **Focus**: Storytelling style, narrative structure, dialogue approach
- **Examples**: Serious, Comedic, Dramatic, Suspenseful, Romantic
- **Collection**: `tone-options`
- **Max Selections**: 2

### **Mood** (Emotional Atmosphere)  
- **Purpose**: Defines the emotional atmosphere and feeling
- **Focus**: What emotions the audience should experience
- **Examples**: Optimistic, Melancholic, Tense, Hopeful, Brooding
- **Collection**: `mood-descriptors`
- **Max Selections**: 2

## Implementation Changes

### 1. Database Schema Updates

**Projects Collection** (`src/collections/Projects.ts`):
- Updated tone field description to focus on narrative approach
- Added new `mood` field with relationship to `mood-descriptors`
- Both fields allow 1-2 selections and are optional

```typescript
// 4. Tone (Essential for story generation)
{
  name: 'tone',
  type: 'relationship',
  relationTo: 'tone-options',
  hasMany: true,
  maxRows: 2,
  description: "Select 1-2 tones that define how the story is told (narrative approach)"
},

// 5. Mood (Essential for story generation)
{
  name: 'mood',
  type: 'relationship',
  relationTo: 'mood-descriptors',
  hasMany: true,
  maxRows: 2,
  description: "Select 1-2 moods that define the emotional atmosphere and feeling"
}
```

### 2. Form Interface Updates

**Project Creation Form** (`src/app/(frontend)/project/create/page.tsx`):
- Added `mood: string[]` to FormData interface
- Added mood options state and fetching
- Separated form fields with distinct labels and descriptions
- Updated API data submission to include mood field

**Project Edit Form** (`src/app/(frontend)/project/[id]/edit/page.tsx`):
- Added mood field to FormData interface and form initialization
- Added mood options fetching and state management
- Separated form fields with proper data binding

### 3. API Integration

**Project Creation API** (`src/app/v1/projects/route.ts`):
- Added 'mood' to relationship fields cleaning array
- Ensures proper handling of mood field data

**Mood Descriptors API**: 
- Existing endpoint at `/v1/config/mood-descriptors` already available

### 4. AI Generation Updates

**Relationship Field Handler** (`src/lib/ai/relationship-field-handler.ts`):
- Added mood configuration to `RELATIONSHIP_FIELD_CONFIGS`
- Added `generateMoods()` function for AI mood generation
- Updated `generateTones()` to focus on narrative approach (2 selections)

**BAML Functions** (`baml_src/project_core_elements.baml`):
- Updated `GenerateTone` function to focus on narrative approach
- Added new `GenerateMood` function for emotional atmosphere generation
- Clear separation of concerns in AI prompts

### 5. User Interface

**Form Layout**:
- **Tone Field**: "Select narrative tones" placeholder, focuses on storytelling style
- **Mood Field**: "Select emotional moods" placeholder, focuses on audience emotions
- Both fields appear in "Core Story Elements" section
- Clear, distinct descriptions for each field

## Benefits

### 1. **Conceptual Clarity**
- Users understand the difference between narrative approach and emotional atmosphere
- More precise data collection for story generation
- Eliminates confusion from merged field

### 2. **Better AI Generation**
- Separate AI functions can specialize in tone vs mood generation
- More targeted prompts produce better results
- Cleaner data structure for screenplay generation

### 3. **Enhanced User Experience**
- Intuitive field separation matches storytelling concepts
- Better guidance through distinct descriptions
- More granular control over story elements

### 4. **Data Quality**
- Two focused collections instead of one mixed collection
- Better relationship mapping for AI processing
- Cleaner data structure for future features

## Technical Details

### Database Collections Used:
- `tone-options` - Narrative tones (existing)
- `mood-descriptors` - Emotional moods (existing)

### API Endpoints:
- `/v1/config/tone-options` - Fetch narrative tones
- `/v1/config/mood-descriptors` - Fetch emotional moods

### Form Validation:
- Both fields are optional during project creation
- Maximum 2 selections per field
- Proper error handling and display

### AI Integration:
- `GenerateTone()` - Focuses on narrative approach
- `GenerateMood()` - Focuses on emotional atmosphere
- Both functions consider project context and existing selections

## Development Implementation

### Clean Implementation:
- No backward compatibility code needed (development stage)
- No fallback or mock data - BAML only for AI generation
- Database will be dropped and reseeded for clean start
- Production-ready code without legacy support

## Testing Verification

✅ **Project Creation**: Both fields appear and function correctly
✅ **Project Editing**: Existing data loads properly, both fields editable  
✅ **API Integration**: Mood field properly saved and retrieved
✅ **Form Validation**: Proper error handling for both fields
✅ **AI Generation**: Separate functions work for tone and mood
✅ **Database Schema**: New mood field properly defined

## Future Enhancements

1. **AI Auto-Fill**: Update AI generation to populate both fields intelligently
2. **Field Dependencies**: Consider mood suggestions based on selected tones
3. **Advanced Filtering**: Filter mood options based on genre/tone selections
4. **Analytics**: Track most popular tone/mood combinations
5. **Validation Rules**: Add smart validation for tone/mood compatibility

## Files Modified

### Core Implementation:
- `src/collections/Projects.ts` - Added mood field
- `src/app/(frontend)/project/create/page.tsx` - Separated form fields
- `src/app/(frontend)/project/[id]/edit/page.tsx` - Updated edit form
- `src/app/v1/projects/route.ts` - Added mood to API handling

### AI Integration:
- `src/lib/ai/relationship-field-handler.ts` - Added mood generation
- `baml_src/project_core_elements.baml` - Added GenerateMood function

### Documentation:
- `docs/tone-mood-separation-implementation.md` - This document

The implementation successfully addresses the user's concern about the inappropriate merging of tone and mood concepts, providing a cleaner, more intuitive interface that better reflects storytelling principles.
