## Voice Description Prompts

### Effective Prompt Examples
```javascript
// Female voices
"Bubbly and excitable female pop star interviewee, youthful, slightly breathless, and very enthusiastic"
"Professional female news anchor, clear articulation, confident and authoritative"
"Warm and caring female teacher, patient and encouraging tone"

// Male voices
"Deep and resonant male narrator, calm and trustworthy"
"Energetic male sports commentator, excited and dynamic"
"Wise elderly male professor, thoughtful and measured speech"

// Character voices
"Mysterious female detective, slightly husky voice with intrigue"
"Young male superhero, confident and heroic tone"
"Friendly female customer service representative, helpful and cheerful"
```

## Voice Prompt Guidelines

### Best Practices
- **Be Specific**: Include age, gender, personality traits
- **Describe Tone**: Mention emotional qualities (bubbly, calm, authoritative)
- **Add Context**: Include profession or character type for better results
- **Voice Qualities**: Mention specific vocal characteristics (breathless, husky, clear)

### Effective Elements
- **Demographics**: Age (youthful, elderly), Gender (male, female)
- **Personality**: Bubbly, calm, confident, mysterious, warm, energetic
- **Profession**: Teacher, narrator, news anchor, customer service
- **Vocal Qualities**: Clear, husky, breathless, resonant, measured

## Preview Text Guidelines

### Limitations
- **Character Limit**: 500 characters maximum
- **Billing**: $30 per 1M characters for preview generation
- **Purpose**: Test the generated voice quality and characteristics

### Effective Preview Text
```javascript
// Test different speech patterns
"Hello there! How are you doing today? This is a test of the voice generation system."

// Test emotions and enthusiasm
"Oh my gosh, this is so exciting! The results are absolutely incredible!"

// Test professional tone
"Good morning. Today we'll be discussing the latest developments in artificial intelligence."

// Test narrative style
"Once upon a time, in a land far away, there lived a curious inventor."
```

## Integration Workflow

### Step 1: Design Voice
```javascript
const voiceDesign = await fal.subscribe("fal-ai/minimax/voice-design", {
  input: {
    prompt: "Professional female narrator, clear and engaging",
    preview_text: "Welcome to our story. Let me guide you through this journey."
  }
});

const voiceId = voiceDesign.data.custom_voice_id;
const previewAudio = voiceDesign.data.audio.url;
```

### Step 2: Use Voice for TTS
```javascript
// Use the generated voice_id with MiniMax TTS models
// (This would be implemented with other MiniMax TTS endpoints)
```

## Pricing
- **Voice Design**: Standard API pricing
- **Preview Audio**: $30 per 1M characters for preview text generation
- **Usage-Based**: Pay per voice generation request

## Performance Considerations
- **Processing Time**: Voice design may take longer than standard TTS
- **Queue System**: Use queue management for production applications
- **Caching**: Store voice_ids for reuse to avoid regeneration costs

## Error Handling
```javascript
try {
  const result = await fal.subscribe("fal-ai/minimax/voice-design", {
    input: {
      prompt: voicePrompt,
      preview_text: previewText
    }
  });
} catch (error) {
  console.error("Voice design failed:", error.message);
}
```

## Use Cases
- **Character Voices**: Create unique voices for game characters or audiobooks
- **Brand Voices**: Design consistent brand voice for marketing content
- **Personalization**: Create custom voices for accessibility applications
- **Content Creation**: Generate diverse voices for podcasts or videos
- **Interactive Applications**: Create engaging voice interfaces
