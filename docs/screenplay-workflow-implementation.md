# Screenplay Workflow Implementation

## Overview

The screenplay workflow is a comprehensive step-by-step system that transforms completed stories into professional screenplays. This implementation provides a structured approach where each step builds upon the previous ones, with clear dependencies and progress tracking.

## Architecture

### Page Structure
- **Main Page**: `/project/[id]/screenplay`
- **Sidebar**: Step-by-step progress tracking with status indicators
- **Content Area**: Detailed step execution interface with expandable sections

### Key Components

1. **ScreenplayPage** (`src/app/(frontend)/project/[id]/screenplay/page.tsx`)
   - Main page component with prerequisite checking
   - Requires completed story before allowing access
   - Integrates with project context

2. **ScreenplayStatusSidebar** (`src/components/screenplay/ScreenplayStatusSidebar.tsx`)
   - Fixed sidebar showing all 9 workflow steps
   - Progress tracking with completion percentage
   - Step availability based on dependencies
   - Visual status indicators (completed, in-progress, not-started, error)

3. **ScreenplayContent** (`src/components/screenplay/ScreenplayContent.tsx`)
   - Main content area with expandable step sections
   - Individual step execution interface
   - Status badges and action buttons

## Workflow Steps

- **Services**: FAL AI, BAML, existing media generation pipeline

### 9. Final Assembly ðŸ”„
- **Purpose**: Complete movie assembly and post-production
- **Dependencies**: Media Generation
- **Estimated Time**: 15-25 minutes

## Technical Implementation

### Navigation Integration
- Updated sidebar navigation to include "Screenplay" menu item
- Modified DashboardLayout to handle screenplay page's custom sidebar
- Screenplay page uses its own sidebar like the Story page

### Status Management
Each step tracks:
- **Status**: `completed | in-progress | not-started | error`
- **Dependencies**: Array of prerequisite step IDs
- **Availability**: Calculated based on dependency completion
- **Metrics**: Quality scores and progress details
- **Estimated Time**: User guidance for planning

### User Experience Features
- **Progress Bar**: Overall completion percentage
- **Step Numbering**: Clear sequence indicators
- **Expandable Sections**: Detailed step information
- **Action Buttons**: Context-aware "Start" buttons
- **Status Badges**: Visual completion indicators
- **Dependency Messaging**: Clear prerequisite requirements

## External Services Integration

### Text-Based Services (Screenplay Generation)
1. **BAML** - AI prompt management and text generation
2. **OpenRouter** - LLM services for story/dialogue generation
3. **CrewAI Server** - AI agent orchestration (Architect & Director crews)
4. **PathRAG** - Story knowledge graph and context management
5. **Redis** - Queue management for long-running tasks
6. **MongoDB** - Data persistence
7. **Novel Movie API** - Project and story data management

### Visual Services (Later Stages)
- **FAL AI** - Media generation services
- **DINOv3** - Character consistency validation (media generation phase only)

## Testing Strategy

### Manual Testing
1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure project has completed story
2. **Navigation**: Verify screenplay menu item appears
3. **Page Access**: Test screenplay page loads correctly
4. **Step Progression**: Verify dependency-based step availability
5. **UI Interaction**: Test expandable sections and action buttons

### Automated Testing
- **Page Accessibility**: Test screenplay page responds correctly
- **Data Requirements**: Verify story prerequisite checking
- **Navigation Integration**: Confirm sidebar updates
- **Service Health**: Individual external service testing

## File Structure

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ app/(frontend)/project/[id]/screenplay/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ page.tsx                           # Main screenplay page
â”œâ”€â”€ components/screenplay/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ScreenplayStatusSidebar.tsx        # Progress sidebar
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ScreenplayContent.tsx              # Main content area
â”œâ”€â”€ components/layout/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ DashboardLayout.tsx                # Updated for screenplay
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Sidebar.tsx                        # Updated navigation
â””â”€â”€ scripts/
    â”œâ”€â”€ test-screenplay-page.js             # Page testing
    â””â”€â”€ test-screenplay-generation.js       # Service testing
```

## Usage Instructions

1. **Access Requirements**: Project must have a completed story
2. **Navigation**: Use sidebar "Screenplay" menu item
3. **Step Execution**: Click "Start" on available steps
4. **Progress Tracking**: Monitor completion in sidebar
5. **Dependencies**: Complete steps in order for best results

This implementation provides a solid foundation for the screenplay generation workflow while maintaining flexibility for future enhancements and integrations.
