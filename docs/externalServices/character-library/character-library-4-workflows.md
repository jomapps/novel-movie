# Character Library Workflows

## 1. Novel Movie Character Creation Workflow

### Standard Character Creation
```
1. Novel Movie App creates character
   POST /api/v1/characters/novel-movie
   ├── Validates character data
   ├── Generates unique character ID
   ├── Creates character record
   └── Sets up Novel Movie integration

2. Automatic PathRAG Sync
   POST /api/v1/pathrag/manage (internal)
   ├── Extracts character knowledge
   ├── Indexes character data
   └── Enables natural language queries

3. Initial Quality Assessment
   GET /api/v1/characters/{id}/quality-metrics
   ├── Analyzes data completeness
   ├── Checks for missing fields
   └── Generates baseline metrics

4. Optional: Initial Image Generation
   POST /api/v1/characters/{id}/generate-initial-image
   ├── Uses exact user prompt (no modifications)
   ├── Generates image via Fal.ai nano-banana model
   ├── Uploads to R2 storage
   ├── Processes with DINOv3 for feature extraction
   ├── Assigns unique DINOv3 asset ID
   ├── Updates character record with master reference
   └── Triggers quality recalculation
```

### Duplicate Prevention Workflow
```
1. Pre-Creation Search
   POST /api/v1/characters/search
   ├── Query: character description
   ├── Similarity threshold: 0.7+
   └── Returns potential duplicates

2. Decision Point
   If similar characters found:
   ├── Use existing character
   ├── Update with new project association
   └── Skip creation

   If no similar characters:
   ├── Proceed with creation
   └── Continue to standard workflow
```

## 2. Character Image Generation Workflow

### Complete Image Set Generation
```
1. Initial Reference Image
   POST /api/v1/characters/{id}/generate-initial-image
   ├── Uses character description
   ├── Creates master reference
   └── Sets baseline visual identity

2. Set Master Reference
   PUT /api/v1/characters/{id}/reference-image
   ├── Confirms master image
   ├── Updates character record
   └── Enables advanced generation

3. Generate 360° Reference Set
   POST /api/v1/characters/{id}/generate-360-set
   ├── Creates 8 angle views
   ├── Maintains visual consistency
   └── Builds complete reference library

4. Scene-Specific Images
   POST /api/v1/characters/{id}/generate-scene-image
   ├── Context-aware generation
   ├── Mood and lighting adaptation
   └── Scene-specific variations
```


### Duplicate Master Reference (HTTP 400) Handling
```
Trigger
- POST /api/v1/characters/{id}/generate-initial-image returns HTTP 400 with error:
  "Character already has a master reference image. Use the generate-image endpoint for additional images."

Novel Movie App Policy
1. Treat this as expected control flow for initial-image generation
2. Client logs an info message (not an error) and throws a structured CharacterLibraryError
   - code: ALREADY_HAS_REFERENCE
   - status: 400
   - body: original error text for debugging
3. Route behavior (server):
   - DELETE /api/v1/characters/{id}/reference-image
   - Retry initial-image generation exactly once
4. No further retries for this case; other 5xx errors are not retried

Notes
- Keeps backend logs clean (no noisy stack traces for this known path)
- Ensures a single master reference image exists at any time
- 360° set and scene image flows are unaffected
```

### Master Reference Reset Workflow
```
⚠️ CRITICAL OPERATION: Complete Character Reset

1. Delete Master Reference
   DELETE /api/v1/characters/{id}/reference-image
   ├── Removes master reference image
   ├── Resets processing status
   └── Clears quality metrics

2. Cascade Reset (Automatic)
   ├── Core set generation status → false
   ├── Image gallery → cleared
   ├── Quality metrics → reset
   ├── Scene context images → cleared
   └── Validation history → cleared

3. Character State After Reset
   ├── Character data preserved (name, bio, etc.)
   ├── Novel Movie integration preserved
   ├── Relationships preserved
   └── All visual content removed

4. Recovery Path
   Must restart image generation workflow:
   ├── POST /api/v1/characters/{id}/generate-initial-image
   ├── PUT /api/v1/characters/{id}/reference-image
   ├── POST /api/v1/characters/{id}/generate-360-set

2. API Response Consistency
   All character endpoints return:
   ├── id: MongoDB ObjectId (for database operations)
   ├── characterId: Business identifier (for display/search)
   ├── External service IDs when applicable
