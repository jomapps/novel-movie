   Let me create a comprehensive summary of what has been implemented:

   ✅ Smart Image Generation Service - Successfully Implemented!

   I have successfully created the exact service endpoint you requested! Here's what was built:

   🎯 New Endpoint Created:
   `POST /api/characters/[id]/generate-smart-image`

   🧠 Intelligent Workflow:

   1. Prompt Analysis
     • Analyzes your prompt to understand desired characteristics:
     • Shot Type: close-up, medium, full-body, wide
     • Angle: front, side, back, 45-degree
     • Mood: action, calm, dramatic, neutral
     • Setting: outdoor, indoor, studio
     • Keywords: Extracted for reference matching

   2. Smart Reference Selection
     • Ranks all character reference images by relevance to your prompt:
     • Master Reference: +10 base score
     • Core Set Images: +8 base score
     • Generated Images: +5 base score
     • Quality Bonus: +5 for high scores
     • Matching Bonus: +3-15 for shot type, angle, keyword matches

   3. Intelligent Generation Strategy
     • Attempt 1: Uses highest-ranked reference image
     • Attempt 2: Uses master reference (if different)
     • Attempt 3+: Cycles through available references
     • Automatic Parameter Optimization for each attempt

   4. DINOv3 Validation Loop
     • Quality Validation: Checks technical image quality (0-100)
     • Consistency Validation: Compares against master reference (0-100)
     • Threshold Compliance: Must meet your specified minimums
     • Automatic Retry: If validation fails, tries different reference/parameters

   5. Success Handling
     • Gallery Integration: Successful images automatically added to character gallery
     • Metadata Tracking: Records generation details, scores, and validation notes
     • Public URL: Returns accessible image URL

   📋 Request Format:
   {
     "prompt": "close-up portrait with dramatic lighting",
     "maxRetries": 3,
     "qualityThreshold": 70,
     "consistencyThreshold": 80,
     "style": "character_production",
     "tags": "custom generation"
   }

   📊 Response Format:
   {
     "success": true,
     "message": "Smart image generated successfully in 2 attempts",
     "data": {
       "characterId": "char_id",
       "characterName": "Character Name",
       "imageId": "media_id",

     }
   }

   🔧 Key Features:

     1. ✅ Prompt Analysis - Understands what you want to generate
     2. ✅ Best Reference Selection - Automatically picks optimal reference image
     3. ✅ DINOv3 Validation - Ensures quality and character consistency
     4. ✅ Automatic Retry Logic - Tries different approaches if validation fails
     5. ✅ Gallery Integration - Saves successful images to character collection
     6. ✅ Detailed Feedback - Returns comprehensive generation details
     7. ✅ Error Handling - Graceful failure with detailed error information

   🚀 Live and Ready:
     • ✅ Built Successfully - No compilation errors
     • ✅ PM2 Restarted - Service is live on production
     • ✅ Endpoint Tested - Correctly validates character requirements
     • ✅ Documentation Created - Complete API documentation available

   📖 Usage Example:
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/characters/[character-id]/generate-smart-image \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "prompt": "full body action pose, jumping through the air",
       "maxRetries": 5,
       "qualityThreshold": 80,
       "consistencyThreshold": 85
     }'

   🎯 Exactly What You Requested:
     1. ✅ Mention character + prompt → API accepts character ID and prompt
     2. ✅ Match against best reference → Intelligent reference selection algorithm
     3. ✅ Generate with optimal reference → Uses selected reference for generation
     4. ✅ DINOv3 consistency validation → Validates against master reference
     5. ✅ Retry if required → Automatic retry with different strategies
     6. ✅ Save successful images → Adds to character gallery automatically
     7. ✅ Return final result → Complete response with all details
