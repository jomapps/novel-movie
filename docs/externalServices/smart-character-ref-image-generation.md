   Let me create a comprehensive summary of what has been implemented:

   âœ… Smart Image Generation Service - Successfully Implemented!

   I have successfully created the exact service endpoint you requested! Here's what was built:

   ðŸŽ¯ New Endpoint Created:
   `POST /api/characters/[id]/generate-smart-image`

   ðŸ§  Intelligent Workflow:

   1. Prompt Analysis
     â€¢ Analyzes your prompt to understand desired characteristics:
     â€¢ Shot Type: close-up, medium, full-body, wide
     â€¢ Angle: front, side, back, 45-degree
     â€¢ Mood: action, calm, dramatic, neutral
     â€¢ Setting: outdoor, indoor, studio
     â€¢ Keywords: Extracted for reference matching

   2. Smart Reference Selection
     â€¢ Ranks all character reference images by relevance to your prompt:
     â€¢ Master Reference: +10 base score
     â€¢ Core Set Images: +8 base score
     â€¢ Generated Images: +5 base score
     â€¢ Quality Bonus: +5 for high scores
     â€¢ Matching Bonus: +3-15 for shot type, angle, keyword matches

   3. Intelligent Generation Strategy
     â€¢ Attempt 1: Uses highest-ranked reference image
     â€¢ Attempt 2: Uses master reference (if different)
     â€¢ Attempt 3+: Cycles through available references
     â€¢ Automatic Parameter Optimization for each attempt

   4. DINOv3 Validation Loop
     â€¢ Quality Validation: Checks technical image quality (0-100)
     â€¢ Consistency Validation: Compares against master reference (0-100)
     â€¢ Threshold Compliance: Must meet your specified minimums
     â€¢ Automatic Retry: If validation fails, tries different reference/parameters

   5. Success Handling
     â€¢ Gallery Integration: Successful images automatically added to character gallery
     â€¢ Metadata Tracking: Records generation details, scores, and validation notes
     â€¢ Public URL: Returns accessible image URL

   ðŸ“‹ Request Format:

     "maxRetries": 3,
     "qualityThreshold": 70,
     "consistencyThreshold": 80,
     "style": "character_production",
     "tags": "custom generation"
   }

   ðŸ“Š Response Format:
   {
     "success": true,
     "message": "Smart image generated successfully in 2 attempts",
     "data": {
       "characterId": "char_id",
       "characterName": "Character Name",

       "selectedReferenceId": "reference_id",
       "selectedReferenceType": "master|core_reference|generated",
       "qualityScore": 85,
       "consistencyScore": 92,
       "attempts": 2,
       "generationTime": 15000,
       "filename": "character_smart_1234567890.jpg"
     }
   }

   ðŸ”§ Key Features:

     1. âœ… Prompt Analysis - Understands what you want to generate
     2. âœ… Best Reference Selection - Automatically picks optimal reference image
     3. âœ… DINOv3 Validation - Ensures quality and character consistency
     4. âœ… Automatic Retry Logic - Tries different approaches if validation fails
     5. âœ… Gallery Integration - Saves successful images to character collection
     6. âœ… Detailed Feedback - Returns comprehensive generation details
     7. âœ… Error Handling - Graceful failure with detailed error information

   ðŸš€ Live and Ready:
     â€¢ âœ… Built Successfully - No compilation errors
     â€¢ âœ… PM2 Restarted - Service is live on production
     â€¢ âœ… Endpoint Tested - Correctly validates character requirements
     â€¢ âœ… Documentation Created - Complete API documentation available

   ðŸ“– Usage Example:
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/characters/[character-id]/generate-smart-image \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "prompt": "full body action pose, jumping through the air",
       "maxRetries": 5,
       "qualityThreshold": 80,
