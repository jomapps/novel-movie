## Testing

### Automated Test Suite

Run the comprehensive test suite:

```bash
node scripts/test-enhanced-character-development.js
```

**Test Coverage:**
- âœ… BAML AI character generation
- âœ… Character relationship generation
- âœ… Character Library integration
- âœ… Character enhancement
- âœ… Character validation
- âœ… Character synchronization

### Manual Testing

1. **Navigate to screenplay page:** `/project/{id}/screenplay`
2. **Complete prerequisites:** Story and story structure
3. **Execute character development step**
4. **Verify generated characters have:**
   - Detailed character profiles
   - Character relationships
   - Character Library integration
   - Quality metrics

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```env
# Character Library Service
CHARACTER_LIBRARY_API_URL=https://character-library.ft.tc
CHARACTER_LIBRARY_TIMEOUT=60000
CHARACTER_LIBRARY_RETRY_ATTEMPTS=3

# BAML Configuration
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your-openrouter-key
OPENROUTER_BASE_URL=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
```

### BAML Functions

The system uses the following BAML functions:
- `DevelopCharacters` - Main character generation
- `EnhanceCharacterProfiles` - Character enhancement
- `ValidateCharacterConsistency` - Consistency validation

## Performance Metrics

### Target Performance
- Character generation: < 30 seconds
- Character enhancement: < 15 seconds per character
- Character validation: < 10 seconds per character
- Character sync: < 5 seconds per character

### Quality Metrics
- Overall quality: > 80%
- Character depth: > 75%
- Arc consistency: > 85%
- Relationship clarity: > 70%
- Dialogue distinction: > 75%

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **BAML Generation Fails**
   - System automatically falls back to story structure extraction
   - Check BAML client configuration and API keys

2. **Character Library Integration Fails**
   - Characters are still created in Novel Movie database
   - Check Character Library service availability
   - Verify environment variables

3. **No Relationships Generated**
   - Ensure story structure has character interactions in story beats
   - Check that multiple characters are being generated

4. **Enhancement/Validation Fails**
   - Verify BAML client is properly configured
   - Check that story content and structure exist

### Debug Information

Enable detailed logging by checking server console output for:
- ðŸ¤– BAML generation status
- ðŸ”— Relationship generation progress
- ðŸŽ¨ Visual asset generation status
- ðŸ”„ Synchronization results

## Next Steps

### Pending Character Library Enhancements

The following features require Character Library service implementation:
- Novel Movie specific API endpoints
- Enhanced database schema
- Bidirectional synchronization
- Advanced consistency validation
- Scene-aware image generation

See `character-development-library-relationship.md` for detailed implementation requirements.
