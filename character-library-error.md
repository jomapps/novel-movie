# Character Library Integration Error Report

## Issue Summary
The Character Development regeneration process is failing to integrate with the Character Library Service, resulting in characters having `characterLibraryId: null` and `characterLibraryStatus: "error"` instead of successful integration.

## Expected Behavior
When regenerating character development, the system should:

1. **Successfully connect** to Character Library Service at `https://character.ft.tc`
2. **Create/update character** using the `/api/v1/characters/novel-movie` endpoint
3. **Return successful response** with character ID
4. **Store character data** with:
   - `characterLibraryId: "68bd818e3fee633abaec0ee7"` (actual ID from service)
   - `characterLibraryStatus: "created"` or `"updated"`
5. **Display in UI** with:
   - Character Library Status: "✓ Synced" 
   - Clickable Character Library ID link

## Current Behavior
Character development regeneration completes but Character Library integration fails:

1. **Character created locally** with proper BAML-generated data
2. **Character Library integration fails** during `syncCharacterWithLibrary()` call
3. **Fallback values stored**:
   - `characterLibraryId: null`
   - `characterLibraryStatus: "error"`
4. **UI displays**:
   - Character Library Status: "⚠ Offline"
   - No Character Library ID link available

## Technical Details

### API Endpoint Being Called
```typescript
// From: src/app/v1/projects/[id]/character-development/route.ts:506
const libraryResult = await syncCharacterWithLibrary(
  character,
  project,
  existingCharacterLibraryId,
)

// Which calls: src/app/v1/projects/[id]/character-development/route.ts:176
const response = await characterLibraryClient.createNovelMovieCharacter(
  characterLibraryData,
  project,
)
```

### Character Library Client Configuration
```typescript
// From: src/lib/config/character-library.ts:2
baseUrl: process.env.CHARACTER_LIBRARY_API_URL || 'https://character.ft.tc'

// From: src/lib/services/character-library-client.ts:61
const endpoint = '/api/v1/characters/novel-movie'
// Full URL: https://character.ft.tc/api/v1/characters/novel-movie
```

### Expected Request Payload
```json
{
  "novelMovieProjectId": "68bc17412fc53800a96365d8",
  "projectName": "fast car",
  "characterData": {
    "name": "Orion",
    "characterId": "orion-1725717338087",
    "status": "in_development",
    "biography": "Orion is a key character in this Short Film.",
    "personality": "Orion exhibits traits consistent with their role as the protagonist of the story.",
    "physicalDescription": "Orion has a distinctive appearance that reflects their role in the story.",
    "age": null,
    "height": "",
    "eyeColor": "",
    "hairColor": ""
  },
  "syncSettings": {
    "autoSync": true,
    "conflictResolution": "novel-movie-wins"
  }
}
```

### Expected Successful Response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "character": {
    "id": "68bd818e3fee633abaec0ee7",
    "name": "Test",
    "status": "in_development",
    "characterId": "test-123",
    "biography": "Test bio",

      "syncStatus": "synced"
    }
  },
  "characterId": "68bd818e3fee633abaec0ee7",
  "syncStatus": "synced"
}
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### SSL Certificate Issue
Manual testing reveals the Character Library Service has SSL certificate validation issues:

```bash
# This fails with SSL error:
curl -X GET https://character.ft.tc/api/health
# Error: CRYPT_E_NO_REVOCATION_CHECK (0x80092012)

# This works with SSL verification disabled:
curl -k -X GET https://character.ft.tc/api/health
# Returns: {"status":"ok","service":"Character Library","version":"2.0.0"}
```

### Node.js Fetch SSL Handling
The Character Library client uses Node.js `fetch()` which enforces SSL certificate validation by default:

```typescript
// From: src/lib/services/character-library-client.ts:178
const response = await fetch(url, {
  method,
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: data ? JSON.stringify(data) : undefined,
  signal: AbortSignal.timeout(this.timeout),
})
```

**Issue**: Node.js `fetch()` cannot ignore SSL certificate issues like `curl -k` can.

## Proposed Solutions

### Option 1: Fix SSL Certificate (Recommended)
Update the Character Library Service SSL certificate to resolve the revocation check issue.

### Option 2: Add SSL Bypass for Development
Modify the Character Library client to bypass SSL validation in development:

```typescript
// Add to character-library-client.ts makeRequest method
const response = await fetch(url, {
  method,
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: data ? JSON.stringify(data) : undefined,
  signal: AbortSignal.timeout(this.timeout),
  // Add SSL bypass for development
  ...(process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' && {
    agent: new (require('https').Agent)({
      rejectUnauthorized: false
    })
  })
})
```

### Option 3: Environment Variable Override
Add environment variable to control SSL validation:

```typescript
// In character-library-client.ts
const httpsAgent = process.env.CHARACTER_LIBRARY_IGNORE_SSL === 'true' 
  ? new (require('https').Agent)({ rejectUnauthorized: false })
  : undefined
```

## Test Verification

### Manual API Test (Working)
```bash
curl -k -X POST https://character.ft.tc/api/v1/characters/novel-movie \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"novelMovieProjectId":"test","projectName":"test","characterData":{"name":"Test","characterId":"test-123","status":"in_development","biography":"Test bio","personality":"Test personality","physicalDescription":"Test description"},"syncSettings":{"autoSync":true,"conflictResolution":"novel-movie-wins"}}'

# Returns: HTTP 201 Created with character ID
```

### Current Novel Movie Integration (Failing)
```bash
# Character development regeneration completes but shows:
# - Character Library Status: "⚠ Offline"  
# - characterLibraryId: null
# - characterLibraryStatus: "error"
```

## Environment Details
- **Character Library Service**: `https://character.ft.tc` (v2.0.0, production)
- **Novel Movie App**: Next.js 15.x with Node.js fetch()
- **SSL Issue**: Certificate revocation check failure (CRYPT_E_NO_REVOCATION_CHECK)
- **Service Status**: Character Library API is functional, SSL certificate needs fixing

## Next Steps
1. **Fix SSL certificate** on Character Library Service to resolve revocation check
2. **Test integration** after SSL fix
3. **Verify character creation** shows proper Character Library ID and status
4. **Confirm UI display** shows "✓ Synced" status with clickable ID links

The Character Library Service API is working correctly - the issue is purely SSL certificate validation preventing the Novel Movie app from connecting successfully.
