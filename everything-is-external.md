Hee is what i am thinking. some things I said earlier will be changed or eliminated and new ones added:
The project will have only 2 fields in its collection at project level. 1) Character name (in project) and 2) Character Library ID.

At this point in project, I will simply generate all the data that library can accept including. the data will be rich and what the library needs. 
So we will generate the character and send it to library. 
then we will proceed to create a refrence image with the data and update in the library
then we will ask the library to do the full 360 set.
With that, the library will be ready  and single source of truth for the character.
